What is a Bucket Key in AWS S3?	<p>A Bucket Key reduces the number of KMS API calls by generating a time-limited key for a bucket, lowering costs and improving scalability.</p>
What happens to an object's ETag when it is transferred between S3 buckets with different encryption settings?	<p>If the source bucket has no encryption but the destination bucket enforces encryption, the object's ETag changes because the content hash differs due to encryption.</p>
